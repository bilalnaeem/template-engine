== Welcome to TemplateEngine

I want you to take this existing, functional 
app and create a new template engine to use
instead of ERB. Currently you can migrate
the DB, enter some basic data for Hamburgers
(the only model), and see the pages generated
by ERB.

I don't want to use ERB anymore. In fact, I
want you to build my very own template system. 

I have created the model, controller, and
template files. The new style of templates
are named *.html.tpl. They are very similar to
the existing ERB templates.

I want you to render all the pages using those
template files and your new template engine.

I also want you to link the names of the 
Hamburgers from the index template to navigate
to the show page for that Hamburger.

The method you use is up to you, but I expect
logical and clean code that is backed by RSpec
tests. Ideally, you will use TDD.

Let me know if you have any questions.

There is a simple solution to this problem and
it should take no more than a couple hours to
complete.
